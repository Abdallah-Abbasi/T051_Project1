Except for the unfixable bug that keeps me from keeping people connected during the UDP match, the gfame is perfectly constructed. I've made multiple unsuccessful attempts to fix it.
The TCP connection is suddenly cut off.
Even if the gameplay (guesses) is sent over UDP, the server keeps an open TCP control channel with each player.
Every time it runs, the server thread check_player_connections() pings that TCP socket and watches for a ping response.
Since my client never transmits that pong, the server assumes the player has dropped after five seconds, closes the TCP socket, and Windows reports WinError 10054: connection forcefully closed by the remote host.
When the TCP side is destroyed, the game loop also ends, so even if the UDP code ran flawlessly, the round ends immediately.
